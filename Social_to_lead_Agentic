# AutoStream Social-to-Lead AI Agent

This project is part of the ServiceHive – Inflx ML Intern Assignment. The agent converts
social media conversations into qualified business leads using intent detection,
retrieval-augmented generation, and stateful lead capture.

# How to Run the Project Locally


git clone https://github.com/karkilalit18/Capstone-Project/blob/main/_Social-to-Lead%20Agentic%20Workflow.ipynb

cd autostream-agent

pip install -r requirements.txt




This project uses an AutoGen-style agentic workflow implemented in Python. AutoGen was
chosen because it supports multi-step conversational agents with memory and tool
execution, making it ideal for building real-world SaaS lead-generation systems.

The agent is composed of three main components. First, an intent detection module
classifies user messages into greeting, product inquiry, or high-intent lead using
keyword-based NLP logic. Second, a lightweight RAG pipeline retrieves pricing and policy
information from a local JSON knowledge base, ensuring responses are grounded in verified
company data. Third, a stateful lead capture workflow maintains conversation context across
multiple turns. Once a high-intent signal is detected, the agent enters a gated flow where
it sequentially collects the user’s name, email, and creator platform. Only after all
three values are collected does it execute the mock_lead_capture() tool, preventing
premature API calls.

📲 WhatsApp Integration Using Webhooks

To deploy this agent on WhatsApp, Twilio’s WhatsApp Business API can be used. Incoming user 
messages are sent to a FastAPI webhook endpoint. Each WhatsApp user ID is mapped to a
persistent agent state stored in memory or Redis. The webhook forwards the message to the
AutoStream agent, and the generated response is returned to the user through Twilio’s API,
enabling real-time conversational lead generation on WhatsApp.
